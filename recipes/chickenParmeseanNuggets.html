    <h1>Chicken Parmesean Nuggets</h1>
    <p>This recipe makes for an easy weeknight dinner that minimizes dishes and makes for easy cleanup. This recipe was derived from my undying love for Chicken Parmesean, and my desire not to cook on a chilled tuesday in January.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Frozen Chicken Nuggets (or tenders)</li>
        <li>Parmesean Cheese or shredded mozzerella works well as a substitute</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce (prepared or jarred)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the chicken tenders on a cast iron skillet</li>
        <li>After they finish cooking in the oven, add a liberal amount of cheese to the top</li>
        <li>Turn on the broiler and return the cheese covered tenders to the oven and check every 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Once the cheese is adequately melted, remove the skillet from the oven and place the chicken on a plate.</li>
        <li>Serve with tomato sauce in a separate bowl, or directly on the chicken.</li>
    </ol>
